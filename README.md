Out Of Service log created a number of years ago, out of an urgent need to keep better track of a
very large inventory of equipment rapidly changeing from "Out Of Service" to "Available" status on a
daily basis.

This version was the prototype and ONLY WORKS ON INTERNET EXPLORER due to some use of Active-X to update
the XML database. It can be (was) easily modified to to use a better server-side technology such as PHP
and plug into whatever inventory application you already use.

Also, from memory, it was designed specifically to be used with a barcode scanner and requires minimal
keyboard/mouse interaction - I say "from memory" because it has been a number of years since I last
used IE and cannot verify.

Really this is just a historical record, more than anything else...
